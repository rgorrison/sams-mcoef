# South American Monsoon System variability in the last millennium 

This code was used in research as part of an international collaboration that builds on the proxy- and modeling-specific expertise of the co-authors to present a unique synthesis of past climate variability in tropical South America. We define the leading modes of variability of the South American Monsoon System (SAMS) during the last millennium from a network of oxygen-isotope proxy records and two isotope-enabled climate models. These modes are interpreted based on present-day SAMS climatology and found to be emergent features of the regional boundary conditions rather than a response to external forcings or internal variability. Finally, multi-centennial shifts in the mean state during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and Little Ice Age show regionally coherent patterns of hydroclimatic change associated with upstream rainout.
